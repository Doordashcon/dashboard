## Process Flow

Below is a comprehensive depiction, following a member's journey from induction, showcasing the various stages they undergo within the fellowship.


### **Becoming a Polkadot Technical Fellowship Member**

A non-member can become ranked by the felowship through `pallet_ranked_collective` or `pallet_core_fellowship` respectively;

**Ranked Collective**

To get added as a member and promoted to **"Rank 1"**, an existing member of the fellowship needs to submit a referendum with the preimage of a batch call that has `fellowshipCollective.addMember` and
`fellowshipCollective.promoteMember` on "2/Proficients" track. Provied the requirements for member has been met as stated in the manifesto.

On Polkadot-JS UI for Polkadot Collectives, navigate to Governance > Fellowship > Referenda and click on "Add Preimage". This preimage can be submitted by anyone.

After the preimage is successfully noted, navigate to Governance > Fellowship > Referenda and click
on "Submit Proposal" (This button is active on the UI only if you have an account that belongs to
the Fellowship). Choose the appropriate track and the origin, and enter the preimage hash of the
batch call that adds and promotes the member.

After the referendum is successfully executed, the member is added to the fellowship with "rank 1".
For example, check the [Referenda 23](https://collectives.subsquare.io/fellowship/referenda/23) on
the Collectives parachain. If a member has to be added and promoted to “rank 5”, the proposal has to
be submitted through track “6/Senior Experts” (Always a track with a rank higher). For example,
check the [Referenda 25](https://collectives.subsquare.io/fellowship/referenda/25) on the
Collectives parachain.

At this time the member is required to call `fellowshipCore.import` to become tracked by the standards that uphold the fellowship.

Future plans include that public members can apply to become a Fellowship candidate by placing a
small deposit (which will be returned once they become members). Their candidacy will go through a
referendum to be approved to become a member.

**Core Fellowship**

A user's account can be directly inducted into the core fellowship with a rank of 0 by an existing member, establishing them as a candidate. 


Within the specified `offboard_timeout`, the candidate must fulfill the necessary requirements. Subsequently, they need to `submit_evident` and gain approval from an existing member to be promoted to "Rank 1" or risk complete offboarding from the fellowship.
