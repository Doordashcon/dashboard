## The Polkadot Technical Fellowship

The Technical Fellowship is a self-governing body of experts and developers of Polkadot and Kusama
networks protocols. It operates on-chain through the Polkadot
[Collectives](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot-collectives-rpc.polkadot.io#/fellowship/referenda)
system chain and off-chain through the [Polkadot Fellows](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows)
repository.

  <h3>From Technical Committee to the Technical Fellowship</h3>
  <p>
    The Polkadot Technical Fellowship was established in 2022 and plays an
    important role in the Polkadot OpenGov. This fellowship replaced the
    [Technical
    Committee](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#technical-committee)
    from Polkadot's first iteration of governance, and will be serving both the
    Polkadot and Kusama networks. This Fellowship is designed to be far broader
    in membership (i.e. to work well with even tens of thousands of members) and
    with far lower barriers to entry both in terms of administrative process
    flow and levels of expertise. For more information, read through the
    [Fellowship
    Manifesto](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/manifesto/blob/0c3df46d76625980b8b48742cb86f4d8fa6dda8d/manifesto.pdf).

Apart from the collectives system chain and the GitHub repository, the Polkadot Technical Fellowship
also uses multiple public avenues to discuss updates related to the Polkadot protocol. Their public
discussions can be viewed on [this chatroom](https://matrix.to/#/#fellowship-members:parity.io) and
their monthly meetings are posted to this OpenDev - Polkadot Fellowship Core Dev Call
[YouTube playlist.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P6Axm4JrmQ&list=PLtyd7v_I7PGlDJCCCLGLjJ0yv33JAEE_-)

## Technical Fellowship Referenda

The fellowship's governance model has multiple tracks with their own approval and support
parameters, where the votes are weighted by the rank of the member. Members of the Fellowship can
vote on any given Fellowship proposal and the aggregated opinion of the members (weighted by their
rank) constitutes the Fellowship's collective opinion. The list of current and historic fellowship
referenda can be viewed on [Polkassembly](https://collectives.polkassembly.io/) or
[Subsquare.](https://collectives.subsquare.io/) The fellowship governance is primarily used for its
membership management, [approving RFCs](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs) and whitelisting
Polkadot OpenGov proposals created on the whitelist track.

### Whitelisting

Polkadot OpenGov allows the Technical Fellowship to authorize an origin known as
"Whitelisted-Caller" to execute with Root-level privileges for calls approved by the Fellowship
(currently only rank 3 members and above can vote for whitelist calls). Note that the
fellowship cannot unanimously change the network parameters, conduct rescues or move assets. The
whitelisted proposals still have to go through the whole life cycle of an OpenGov referendum and can
only be enacted when the referendum passes successfully.

The whitelisting process starts as a fellowship referenda with embedded XCM call from the
collectives system chain to the Polkadot relay chain. For instance,
[the Polkadot Fellowship referenda 68](https://collectives.polkassembly.io/referenda/68) was used to
**whitelist** [the Polkadot OpenGov referenda 440](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/440).
