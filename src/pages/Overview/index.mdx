## The Polkadot Technical Fellowship

The Technical Fellowship is a mostly self-governing expert body with a primary goal of representing
humans who embody and contain the technical knowledge base of the Kusama and/or Polkadot networks
and protocols. This is accomplished by associating a rank with members to categorize the degree to
which the system expects their opinion to be well-informed, of a sound technical basis, and in line
with the interests of Polkadot and/or Kusama.

<div className="note">
  <h3>From Technical Committee to the Technical Fellowship</h3>
  <p>
    The Polkadot Technical Fellowship is a collection of Substrate experts. This
    fellowship was established in 2022. In Polkadot OpenGov, this fellowship
    replaces the [Technical
    Committee](./learn-governance.md#technical-committee) in Governance v1, and
    will serve both the Polkadot and Kusama networks.
  </p>
</div>

Unlike the Technical Committee in Governance V1, the Fellowship is designed to be far broader in
membership (i.e. to work well with even tens of thousands of members) and with far lower barriers to
entry (both in terms of administrative process flow and expectations of expertise).

The mechanism by which the Fellowship votes is the same as what is used for Polkadot and Kusama
stakeholder voting for a proposed referendum. Members of the Fellowship can vote on any given
Fellowship proposal and the aggregated opinion of the members (weighted by their rank) constitutes
the Fellowship's considered opinion.

The Polkadot Technical Fellowship resides on the
[Collectives](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot-collectives-rpc.polkadot.io#/fellowship/referenda)
parachain and maintains the [Polkadot Fellows](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows) repository. The
fellowship also has its own governance model with multiple tracks with approval and support
parameters, where the votes are weighted by the rank of the member.  
The fellowship governance is primarily used for its membership management,
[approving RFCs](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs) and whitelisting Polkadot OpenGov
proposals.

### **Ranking System**

To prevent a small group of participants from gaining effective control over the network, this
system will adhere to three main principles:

- The Fellowship must never have hard power over the network: it cannot change the parameters,
  conduct rescues or move assets. Their only power in governance is reducing the effective timeline
  on which a referendum takes place through [whitelisting](#whitelisting).
- The Fellowship weights those with a higher rank more in the aggregate opinion. However, the weight
  should not be so high as to make a small number of higher members’ opinions be insurmountable
  compared to a coherent opinion from lower-ranked membership.
- The Fellowship should be designed to grow and develop its membership, aggregate levels of
  expertise and ensure that its overall decision-making capacity strengthens over time.

To support these conditions, the Fellowship will have a constitution that outlines the requirements
and expectations for individuals to attain and retain any given rank. Higher ranks can vote and
promote lower ranks based on this constitution.

**Demotion** occurs automatically after a given period has elapsed, and the member is unable to
defend their position to their peers.

**Suspension** can happen only through a referendum, which ensures that the Fellowship's bias alone
does not necessarily result in expulsion.

To prevent the Fellowship from becoming a cabal (popularity with Fellowship peers alone should not
be enough to gain access to a top rank), gaining access to the top tiers of the ranks will require a
referendum.

### **Whitelisting**

Polkadot OpenGov allows the Fellowship to authorize a new origin (known as "Whitelisted-Caller") to
execute with Root-level privileges for calls that have been approved by the Fellowship (currently
only level-three fellows and above can vote for whitelist calls).

The [Whitelist](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_whitelist/) pallet allows one
Origin to escalate the privilege level of another Origin for a certain operation. The pallet
verifies two things:

- The origin of the escalation is the Whitelisted-Root (i.e. that the referendum passed on this
  track), and
- The whitelist contains the given proposal (in the configuration of Polkadot OpenGov, it gets there
  via a separate Fellowship referendum).

If both conditions are true, the operation executes with Root-level privileges.

This system enables a new parallel Track (Whitelisted-Caller), whose parameters have less
restrictive passing parameters than Root in the short term. Through an open and transparent process,
a body of global experts on the Polkadot
protocol have determined that the action is both safe and time-critical.

### **Becoming a Polkadot Technical Fellowship Member**

Currently, the only way to become a fellowship member is through a referenda. To get added as a
member of **"Rank 1"**, an existing member of the fellowship needs to submit a referendum with the
preimage of a batch call that has `fellowshipCollective.addMember` and
`fellowshipCollective.promoteMember` on "2/Proficients" track.

On Polkadot-JS UI for Polkadot
Collectives, navigate to Governance > Fellowship > Referenda and click on "Add Preimage".

This preimage can be submitted by anyone.

<img className={"adj-img"} src={preimage} alt="preimage" />

After the preimage is successfully noted, navigate to Governance > Fellowship > Referenda and click
on "Submit Proposal" (This button is active on the UI only if you have an account that belongs to
the Fellowship). Choose the appropriate track and the origin, and enter the preimage hash of the
batch call that adds and promotes the member.

<img className={"adj-img"} src={proposal} alt="proposal" />

After the referendum is successfully executed, the member is added to the fellowship with "rank 1".
For example, check the [Referenda 23](https://collectives.subsquare.io/fellowship/referenda/23) on
the Collectives parachain. If a member has to be added and promoted to “rank 5”, the proposal has to
be submitted through track “6/Senior Experts” (Always a track with a rank higher). For example,
check the [Referenda 25](https://collectives.subsquare.io/fellowship/referenda/25) on the
Collectives parachain.

Future plans include that public members can apply to become a Fellowship candidate by placing a
small deposit (which will be returned once they become members). Their candidacy will go through a
referendum to be approved to become a member.
