## The Polkadot Technical Fellowship

The Technical Fellowship is a mostly self-governing expert body with a primary goal of representing
humans who embody and contain the technical knowledge base of the Kusama and/or Polkadot networks
and protocols. This is accomplished by associating a rank with members to categorize the degree to
which the system expects their opinion to be well-informed, of a sound technical basis, and in line
with the interests of Polkadot and/or Kusama.

<div className="note">
  <h3>From Technical Committee to the Technical Fellowship</h3>
  <p>
    The Polkadot Technical Fellowship is a collection of Substrate experts. This
    fellowship was established in 2022. In Polkadot OpenGov, this fellowship
    replaces the Technical Committee in Governance v1, and
    will serve both the Polkadot and Kusama networks.
  </p>
</div>

Unlike the Technical Committee in Governance V1, the Fellowship is designed to be far broader in
membership (i.e. to work well with even tens of thousands of members) and with far lower barriers to
entry (both in terms of administrative process flow and expectations of expertise).

The mechanism by which the Fellowship votes is the same as what is used for Polkadot and Kusama
stakeholder voting for a proposed referendum. Members of the Fellowship can vote on any given
Fellowship proposal and the aggregated opinion of the members (weighted by their rank) constitutes
the Fellowship's considered opinion.

The Polkadot Technical Fellowship resides on the
[Collectives](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot-collectives-rpc.polkadot.io#/fellowship/referenda)
parachain and maintains the [Polkadot Fellows](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows) repository. The
fellowship also has its own governance model with multiple tracks with approval and support
parameters, where the votes are weighted by the rank of the member.  
The fellowship governance is primarily used for its membership management,
[approving RFCs](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs) and whitelisting Polkadot OpenGov
proposals.

### **Ranking System**

To prevent a small group of participants from gaining effective control over the network, this
system will adhere to three main principles:

- The Fellowship must never have hard power over the network: it cannot change the parameters,
  conduct rescues or move assets. Their only power in governance is reducing the effective timeline
  on which a referendum takes place through [whitelisting](#whitelisting).
- The Fellowship weights those with a higher rank more in the aggregate opinion. However, the weight
  should not be so high as to make a small number of higher membersâ€™ opinions be insurmountable
  compared to a coherent opinion from lower-ranked membership.
- The Fellowship should be designed to grow and develop its membership, aggregate levels of
  expertise and ensure that its overall decision-making capacity strengthens over time.

To support these conditions, the Fellowship will have a constitution that outlines the requirements
and expectations for individuals to attain and retain any given rank. Higher ranks can vote and
promote lower ranks based on this constitution.

**Demotion** occurs automatically after a given period has elapsed, and the member is unable to
defend their position to their peers.

**Suspension** can happen only through a referendum, which ensures that the Fellowship's bias alone
does not necessarily result in expulsion.

To prevent the Fellowship from becoming a cabal (popularity with Fellowship peers alone should not
be enough to gain access to a top rank), gaining access to the top tiers of the ranks will require a
referendum.

### **Whitelisting**

Polkadot OpenGov allows the Fellowship to authorize a new origin (known as "Whitelisted-Caller") to
execute with Root-level privileges for calls that have been approved by the Fellowship (currently
only level-three fellows and above can vote for whitelist calls).

The [Whitelist](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_whitelist/) pallet allows one
Origin to escalate the privilege level of another Origin for a certain operation. The pallet
verifies two things:

- The origin of the escalation is the Whitelisted-Root (i.e. that the referendum passed on this
  track), and
- The whitelist contains the given proposal (in the configuration of Polkadot OpenGov, it gets there
  via a separate Fellowship referendum).

If both conditions are true, the operation executes with Root-level privileges.

This system enables a new parallel Track (Whitelisted-Caller), whose parameters have less
restrictive passing parameters than Root in the short term. Through an open and transparent process,
a body of global experts on the Polkadot
protocol have determined that the action is both safe and time-critical.

## Technical Fellowship Ranking and Salary

The Fellowship [manifesto](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/manifesto) outlines the requirements
and expectations for individuals to attain and retain any given rank, ranging between 0 to 9. By
default, an active account on the collectives system chain has no assigned rank and can be inducted
into the Polkadot Technical Fellowship starting with rank 0. The Fellowship Manifesto states that
members should receive a monthly allowance on par with gross income in OECD countries. A
[fellowship RFC](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/50) was proposed with concrete
amounts for each ranked members.

| Dan  |      Title      | Annual Salary |
| :--: | :-------------: | :-----------: |
|  I   |     Member      |    $10,000    |
|  II  |   Proficient    |    $20,000    |
| III  |     Fellow      |    $80,000    |
|  IV  |    Architect    |   $120,000    |
|  V   | Architect Adept |   $160,000    |
|  VI  | Grand Architect |   $200,000    |
| VII  |   Free Master   |   $200,000    |
| VIII | Master Constant |   $200,000    |
|  IX  |  Grand Master   |   $200,000    |

## Membership Management

The Polkadot technical Fellowship was initally [seeded](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/seeding)
with its members and their corresponding ranks, and got
[added on to Polkadot's Collectives](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/403) system chain. All
new membership requests will go through the fellowship governance and the procedure is outlined in
the section below.


### Becoming a Member

As a member of the Polkadot Technical Fellowship, you are expected to faithfully uphold the below
tenets:

- Sincerely uphold the interests of Polkadot and avoid actions which clearly work against it.
- Respect the philosophy and principles of Polkadot.
- Respect the operational procedures, norms and voting conventions of the Fellowship.
- Respect fellow Members and the wider community.

<div className="note">
  <p>

    For new fellowship inductions, Polkassembly has created an interface (still in beta) to
    [apply for the Polkadot Technical Fellowship.](https://collectives.polkassembly.io/join-fellowship?network=collectives)
    This initiative is funded by Polkadot treasury through
    [OpenGov referendum 373](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/574)

  </p>
</div>

The fellowship manifesto states that any account may register to become a candidate for a basic
deposit, but that feature has not been added to the collectives runtime yet. To be added as a
candidate of the Polkadot Technical Fellowship, a pre-existing member with rank greater than or
equal to 1 can initiate the process. The fellowship membership management is administered through
the
[core fellowship](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/substrate/frame/core-fellowship/src/lib.rs)
pallet.

Before starting the candidate induction process, please ensure the candidate account is active and
has a balance greater than the existential deposit of the collectives system chain (0.1 DOT). It is
recommended that the candidate account also has a verified identity.

The first step is to add a preimage on the collectives system chain. This preimage should include
the call to `induct` a candidate account, as shown below. The preimage can be added by any account
on the collectives system chain. The preimage hash of this call will later be used for creating a
fellowship referenda with an approriate origin and track.

<img className={"adj-img"} src={preimage} alt="preimage" />

The next step is to create a fellowship referenda, which can only be done by a pre-existing
Technical Fellowship member. When a fellowship member navigates to Governance > Fellowship >
Referenda, they should be able to see a submit proposal button. In the example below,submission
track is chosen as `1/members`, origin as `FellowshipOrigins` and fellowship origins as `Members`.
This selection should work for inducting an account without any rank to the fellowship as a
candidate with rank 0. After copying the preimage hash in the designated field, the preimage length
will automatically be populated.

<img className={"adj-img"} src={proposal} alt="proposal" />

After submitting the proposal, the voting can commence. A decision deposit needs to be placed for
this fellowship referendum to be decided. After the fellowship referenda successfully passes, the
candidate is successfully inducted into the Polkadot Fellowship with rank 0.

### Rank Updates

The Polkadot Technical Fellowship members are expected to provide a periodic evidence to request for
retaining their rank or to get promoted to a higher rank. 

#### Promotion

Any fellowship member upto rank 4 can be
promoted to the next rank through a fellowship referenda that can be voted by the members who are 2
ranks higher. For instance, the fellowship
[referenda 64](https://collectives.subsquare.io/fellowship/referenda/64) which promotes a member
from rank 1 to rank 2 can only be voted by members whose ranks are greater than or equal to 3.
Promotion of the Polkadot Fellowship members from rank 5 needs to be done through an OpenGov
referendum.

This preimage example should include the call to `promote` an account to a specific rank, as shown
below. This preimage can be added by any account on the collectives system chain.

<img className={"adj-img"} src={preimagepromote} alt="preimage" />

In the snapshot below, the submission track is chosen as `21/Promote to I Dan`, origin as
`FellowshipOrigins` and fellowship origins as `PromoteTo1Dan`. This selection should work for
promoting a candidate with rank 0 to a member with rank 1.

<img className={"adj-img"} src={proposalpromote} alt="proposal" />

For promoting a member from Rank 1 to Rank 2, the submission track can be chosen as `22/Promote to  II Dan`, origin as
`FellowshipOrigins` and fellowship origins as `PromoteTo2Dan`. Only the members with Rank >= 3 can 
vote on this proposal.

#### Retain Rank

To retain a rank, the Polkadot Fellowship members are expected to submit evidence of work in an
on-going basis.


#### Demotion and Suspension

**Demotion** occurs automatically after a given period has elapsed, and the member is unable to
defend their position to their peers.

**Suspension** can happen only through a Polkadot OpenGov referendum, which ensures that the
Fellowship's bias alone does not necessarily result in expulsion.
